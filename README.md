**University Energy Management Analysis**

**Overview**

This repository contains the data and analysis for a Master of Business Data Science thesis project at the University of Otago. The project focuses on energy usage analysis, trend identification, clustering, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling for university energy management.

**Project Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

Gas_data.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for gas consumption analysis

LTHW.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for Low Temperature Hot Water analysis

Modelling_Gas.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for gas usage modeling

MTHW.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for Medium Temperature Hot Water analysis

stream_dataset.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for stream data analysis

stream_FGH.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for specific stream (FGH) analysis

Castle_data.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for Castle-related data analysis

/Output_PDFs: Folder containing exported PDF versions of the notebooks for reference


**Data Science Focus**

This project emphasizes data science techniques, including:

Energy usage analysis and trend identification

Clustering of energy consumption patterns

Anomaly detection in energy usage data

Predictive modeling for future energy consumption


**Getting Started**

To run the analysis:

Clone this repository

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed

Open the desired .ipynb file in Jupyter

Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis


**Output**

For a quick overview of the results, refer to the PDF outputs in the /Output_PDFs folder. These documents provide a static view of the executed notebooks with all visualizations and findings.


**Contributing**

This project is part of a Master's thesis and is not open for external contributions at this time.

**Contact**
